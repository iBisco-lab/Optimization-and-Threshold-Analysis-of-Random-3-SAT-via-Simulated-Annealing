# Optimization-and-Threshold-Analysis-of-Random-3-SAT-via-Simulated-Annealing
Exploring 3-SAT complexity with simulated annealing — optimization, thresholds, and computational experiments.

The repository demonstrates how simulated annealing can be applied to NP-complete problems, exploring the transition between “easy” and “hard” instances as the clause-to-variable ratio increases.

It includes:

  A K-SAT instance generator (KSAT.py).
  A Simulated Annealing solver (SimAnn.py).
  Scripts for running experiments and visualizing results (KSATrun.py, 3SAT properties.py).
  Analysis of acceptance rates, solving probabilities, and algorithmic thresholds in random 3-SAT instances (Report.pdf)
